## Feature

- **vanilla respect**: all the modules are designed to be as light-way as possible, and do the least changes to the
  vanilla game. (Never touch the game-logic.)
- **fully modular**: you can disable any module completely if you don't like it. (Code is data is code. Thanks to the
  power of meta-programming, the module loader will even not load and inject the module codes into the game, if you
  disable the module, without any performance and compatibility issue.)
- **high performance**: keep performance in mind while coding. (By data-structure, algorithm, lazy-evaluation,
  multi-threading, event-driven and cache to improve performance greatly.)
- **easy to use**: a text-based per-field-explained auto-generated always-up-to-date documentation is provided. (The
  configuration uses lots of mini-language and generators to provide a unified setup.)
- **free**: it's free and open source, with GPL licence.
