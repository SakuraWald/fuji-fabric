\sss{sort}

\ssss{Purpose}
If enable this module, the \ttt{player names} in \ttt{tab list} will be sorted by \ttt{weight}.
\\
The default weight is 0, the range of weight is [0, 675], which means you can set at most 676 sort groups.

\ssss{How it works}
The tab list sort method is client-side decided.So the workaround is to send virtual-player entry to the client-side, and hide the real player in client-side's tablist.
\\
In this case, the client-side will find that, all command target selector will display the virtual-player.
\\
And you can see the virtual-player in client-side's Player Reporting UI.

\begin{note}{The virtaul player has no perforamnce issue}
    The virtual-player is just an entry listed in tab list, when the client ask the server tab list, the server lie with the virtual-player list.
    \\
    There is not a real player entity in the server side, so no extra performance problem.
    \\
    The sync method is event-based, and cached, so the performance is good.
\end{note}

\ssss{Example}
\begin{example}{Set a weight in a group}
    \ttt{Issue the command }\ic{/lp group default meta set fuji.tab\_list.sort.weight 1}\\
    After you set a new weight, you should issue \ic{/fuji reload} or re-connect to refresh the tab-list.
\end{example}
