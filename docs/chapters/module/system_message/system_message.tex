\s{system\_message}

\ss{Purpose}
This module provides \tbf{system message} customization.

\begin{note}{What is system message?}
    Here are some messages that are system message:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item player join and leave server message
        \item player advancement message
        \item player death message
        \item player command feedback
        \item player whitelist message
    \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

\begin{note}{Server-side message and Client-side message}
    It should be noted that, no all messages inside \href{https://github.com/sakurawald/fuji-fabric/blob/dev/.github/files/en_us.json}{mojang's official language file} are server-side message.
    If a message is client-side message, which means that the message is only used in client-side, then the module will have no effects on this message.
\end{note}

\begin{warn}{Possible conflicting with StyledChat}
    If you are using this module with \tbf{StyledChat} mod installed, you need to remove the conflicting \tbf{language keys} in \tbf{key2value} configuration. \\
